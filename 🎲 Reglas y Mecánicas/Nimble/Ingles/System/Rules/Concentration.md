Some activities require Concentration to maintain. A character can only concentrate on one activity at a time. Whenever a character is **crit** while concentrating, they must make a **DC 10 STR save**. Failing this means Concentration is broken and the activity fails. Concentration is automatically broken whenever a character drops to 0 HP or is incapacitated.
