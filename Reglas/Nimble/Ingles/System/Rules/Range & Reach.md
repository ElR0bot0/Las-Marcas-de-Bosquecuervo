Certain abilities, weapons, and spells have a specified Range or Reach, which determines how far away your target can be affected. If none is specified, default to Reach 1.
* In Melee. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage (Reach attacks are not so affected).
* Long Range. You can gain disadvantage 1 to gain +2 Range on any Ranged attack (max +6).

> [!tip]- Abstracted Distances
> If preferred, you can use a more abstracted system of distance just as well. Use **Close**, **Midrange**, and **Far**. A move from Midrange can traverse to Close or Far. Close creatures can be affected Reach/Range 4; Midrange, up to 6; beyond that is Far. As always, the GM will adjudicate unclear situations and which creatures are affected by abilities with an area of effect.
